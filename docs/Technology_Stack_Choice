Our development IDE is Webstorm due to our wise professor's recommendation and the quality of code the application autogenerates 
for node.js web applications and we used postman to generate the initial code for the API call. The language stack that we're 
using for our prototype implements the pug templating engine on the front end along with javascript and css. We're using 
javascript and css due to them being the default languages of front end development and we're using pug because that is Webstorm's 
default choice and the simplicity of the engine. We're using Ajax to asynchronusly pull data from the backend using user input so
that we do not need to reload the page to display the information the user asked for. We're also currently using Node.js to build 
the backend and communicate with our APIs to create better consistancy between the front and backend. We're pulling the information
from our API in JSON format and we're also currently storing our API keys in a JSON file so that we can more easily parse the 
information due to it being in javascript object notation and being more compatible with javascript code. Our code is stored on 
github due to course requirements and our team's main method of communication is facebook messanger because that is what we can
count on people to check.

Our team had an intention on using Java for the backend due to multiple members having more experience with the language, however
since Node.js allowed us to fulfil the needs of the prototype more quickly and effiently we went with that language for the time
being. Reccomendations from our professor and classmates about which tools were simple and aloud for rapid progress played a large
part in our choice of technology stack.
