User Story 1:
As a new user, Jimmy will be greeted with a page asking him to login or create an account, Jimmy needs to click create an account and provide a email address and a password. Once entered, Jimmy will click a button to move forward so that the application creates his account. If the same email address has not been used for another account, then the page will tell him that the account was successfully created and redirect him to the home page to login. If not, then the attempt will be wiped from the text boxes and a message that the the email is already taken will be displayed.

User Story 2:
As a returning user, Jimmy will come to the web app’s home page which has the options to login or create an account. Jimmy will need to press login and be redirected to a page where he can enter the credentials to login. Once Jimmy has entered the credentials, if the email or password is incorrect, then they will be told that the credentials are invalid and the attempt will be wiped from the text boxes. If the credentials match a user, Jimmy will be redirected so that he is on the logged-in home page.

User Story 3:
As a logged in user on the logged-in home page, Jimmy should be able to enter the location he wants to check the price of living in into a text box, and input with a series of checkboxes whether he will need housing and/or food as well the length of stay in the city, and the amount of money he has saved up and the amount he will earn so that the application returns how much it would cost for various living arrangements in that city and whether that is within his means. If any of the Jimmy’s inputs are invalid the application will ask that Jimmy check their spelling and re-input the information needed. Jimmy will then have the option to save any search results to his favorites.
